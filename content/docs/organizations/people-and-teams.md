## People and Teams

To start managing your organization you will first need to start adding people to it.

When you're part of the **owners** team on an organization you're allowed to access
the settings page. You can reach that page via the organziations profile page.
The manage buttons on that page will only be visible for team members on the
**owners** team.

### People

Managing members happens in the people section of your organization's settings page.

> You can only add users who are signed up for wercker

After adding a user to the organization, you can set the visibility of their
membership as either `public` or `private`. That enables you to hide certain
people from the organization's public profile.

Now that you have added some people you can start adding them to a team.

### Teams

Managing teams happens in the teams tab of your organization's settings page.

All organizations have an **owners** team which is created together with the
organization. The owners team is responsible for managing the organization's
settings, members and teams.

When you create a new team called **frontend** for example, you can start
adding team members.

Next step is adding an application to your organization so you can add teams to
collaborate with.
