### The box

The Docker Hub has various containers for ruby available.
There is a default container that you can find [here](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/ruby/). For this guide we
we will be using the [phusion passenger container](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/phusion/passenger-ruby22/) that comes with ruby 2.2.

Define your selected container in your [wercker.yml
file](/learn/wercker-yml/01_introduction.html) using the `box` clause.

```yaml
box: phusion/passenger-ruby22
```
