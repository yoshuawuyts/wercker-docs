# S3

[Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is great deploy target for static content such as `css`,
`images` or `javascript` but also entire blogs, created for instance
with [middleman](middlemanapp.com), [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or
[hugo](http://gohugo.io/).

In this article we will explain how to deploy your assets to S3 with
wercker.

## The S3sync Step

The S3sync step is available in the wercker [marketplace](https://app.wercker.com/#applications/51c82a063179be4478002245/tab/details) and
synchronizes the assets created through the wercker build pipeline with
Amazon S3.

In order to use the S3sync step you add the following to your
[wercker.yml](/docs/wercker-yml/creating-a-yml.html) file.


```yaml
deploy:
    steps:
    - s3sync:
        source_dir: build/
        delete-removed: true
        bucket-url: $AWS_BUCKET_URL
        key-id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        key-secret: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

```

The `source_dir` option which is optional creates an identical folder in the bucket specified
with the `bucket-url` option. By default the value of `source_dir` is
set to `./`. The synchronized files will get an public
access level. The optional `delete-removed` option is set to `true`
meaning that any files not in the `source_dir` are removed from S3.

The `key-id` and `key-secret` options which are required hold your
credentials. It is *highly* recommended you use [environment
variables](/docs/environment-variables/deploy-variables.html) to specify these values.

The `bucket-url` key holds the s3 bucket to which the files should be
synchronized. Again it is recommended to sue [environment variables](/docs/environment-variables/deploy-variables.html)
for this. The url should be in the following format: `s3://example.com`.
