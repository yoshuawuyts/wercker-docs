## Local builds

Starting a local build is as simple as going to the root of your repository and
run `wercker build`. 

For more information on how to install/run the wercker cli see:
[installing](/docs/cli/installing.html) and for pointers on how to debug local builds, see: [introspecting builds](/docs/build/introspecting-builds.html)
