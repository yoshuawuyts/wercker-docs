## Tested containers

With opening wercker up to Docker containers, any Docker image can be
leveraged as either a language box or service. It's impossible to test
all of these containers within wercker but we've still collected a list
of containers that we use ourselves and are working in our pipelines:

* [MongoDB](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mongo/)
* [Golang](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/golang/)
* [Python](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/python/)
* [Gox](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/tcnksm/gox/)
* [Nodesource Nodejs](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/nodesource/trusty/)

We'll update this list with other containers that we use ourselves.
