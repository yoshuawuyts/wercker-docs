## Available environment variables

There are a number of environment variables defined during a build (as well as
during a deploy). They contain a variety of information, such as links to the
current application, build or deploy as well as the branch name and the location
of your application's unique cache.

### Build related variables

Let's take a look at a selection of them available during a build:

<table border="0">
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>VARIABLE NAME</th>
        <th>EXAMPLE VALUE</th>
        <th>PURPOSE/CONTAINS</th>
    </tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_MAIN_PIPELINE_STARTED</td>
    <td>1399372237</td>
    <td>Time in milliseconds when the build started</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>CI</td>
    <td>true</td>
    <td>Can be used to detect if the app/script is running in an automated environment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_BUILD_URL</td>
    <td>https://app.....178b</td>
    <td>Link to the build on wercker</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_GIT_DOMAIN</td>
    <td>github.com</td>
    <td>The domain the repository is cloned from (i.e. bitbucket.org or github.com)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_GIT_OWNER</td>
    <td>wercker</td>
    <td>The owner of the repository</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_GIT_REPOSITORY</td>
    <td>step-bundle-install</td>
    <td>The name of the repository</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_GIT_BRANCH</td>
    <td>master</td>
    <td>The branch name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_GIT_COMMIT</td>
    <td>ef306b2479a7ecd433

    <td>The commit hash</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_ROOT</td>
    <td>/pipeline/build"</td>
    <td>The location of the cloned code</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_SOURCE_DIR</td>
    <td>$WERCKER_ROOT/src</td>
    <td >The path to the directory of the source code. By default WERCKER_ROOT and WERCKER_SOURCE_DIR are the same. However you can change this location via the wercker.yml (to a subfolder in your repository)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_CACHE_DIR</td>
    <td>/cache</td>
    <td>The path to the cache directory. This directory will be stored after the pipeline completes and restored when the pipeline runs again</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_OUTPUT_DIR</td>
    <td>/pipeline/output/</td>
    <td>Any files here are assumed to be the result of the build process. If this folder is empty, the WERCKER_ROOT is assumed to contain the build result</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_STARTED_BY</td>
    <td>Jacco Flenter</td>
    <td>build was started by this user</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>WERCKER_APPLICATION_URL</td>
    <td>https://app......19ef</td>
    <td>URL of the application on wercker</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

When a step is executed, wercker also creates additional environment variables
for you to use. Please see [the steps section](/learn/steps/01_introduction.html).

### Deploy related variables

The following variables are available during deploys. As you can see it's more
or less an expanded version of the information available during a build.
