## Auto deployment

Wercker supports auto-deployment, this means that a green build automatically
gets deployed to a specified deploy target.

This is convenient for low-risk applications such as your blog
or to deploy to either a staging environment or feature branch environment.

As such, wercker allows you to specify the git branch that you want auto
deployed.

Auto deployment is specified in the wercker web interface depending on
the branch and can be specified per deploy target.
