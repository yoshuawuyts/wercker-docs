## Introduction to pipelines

A key concept within wercker is the *pipeline*; a sequence of steps aimed at building,
testing and delivering your applications.

Currently wercker support two types of pipelines; a **build** and a
**deploy** pipeline. Pipelines can be executed [locally](/learn/build/02_local-builds.html) through the
[CLI](/learn/basics/03_the-wercker-cli.html), and on the wercker platform.
