## Step registry

You can also create your own steps and use them in your pipelines. These
steps can be deployed to the registry, a marketplace of steps created by
the wercker community.

All steps are currently public and free for all users to incorporate in
their pipelines.

The creation of steps is currently not support in the Ewok version of
wercker.

All steps that are currently deployed in the wercker registry are
however avaible to use as well as new ones created on the non-Ewok
version of wercker.

> Keep an eye on our blog and documentaiton for when we do support step
creation and deployment on Ewok.
