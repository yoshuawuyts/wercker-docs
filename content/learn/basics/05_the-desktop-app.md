## The desktop application

Wercker also provides a desktop application for Mac OSX that you can use
for receiving notifications.

The desktop app has a a *feed view* that showcases the status of builds and deploys across your projects.
It also comes with a *notification view* that shows notifications such as comments that are also available in the web interface.

You're able to navigate the different views using keyboard shortcuts and if desktop notifications become too much you can turn these off.
