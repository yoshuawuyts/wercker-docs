# The wercker command line interface

The wercker command or command line interface allows you to interfact with the wercker platform from the comfort of your terminal.

It is open source so feel free to [fork](https://github.com/wercker/wercker-cli) it and improve upon it. We'd also welcome any ports to other programming languages such as Ruby. In the mean time you can read about [how to install](/articles/cli/installation.html) the tool and the [commands](/articles/cli/commands.html) it supports.
