# Improving your Golang build times

Here are the steps including their duration [from one of the builds](https://app.wercker.com/#build/51dfef45bf67fc2f7500046a)
of my own golang project called [httpcallback.io](https://github.com/pjvds/httpcallback.io):

1. get code (0 sec)
2. setup environment (15 sec)
3. environment variables (0 sec)
4. setup golang (0 sec)
5. **go get (55 sec)**
6. go build (0 sec)
7. go test (1 sec)
8. saving build output (0 sec)

Total time: 1 min 14 sec

This means that the `go get` step constitutes 75% of my build time.

## Wercker cache

Wercker has a per project build cache directory that is shared betweens builds.
A build can update the cache by writing to the `$WERCKER_CACHE_DIR`
directory. If the build succeeds, this directory is saved for future
builds. We can levarage this to cache for our golang
[workspace](http://blog.denevell.org/golang-workspaces.html).

## Go workspace

The [golang box](https://github.com/pjvds/box-golang) that I have
created in order to add Go support to wercker sets up a Go workspace in `$HOME/go`. This workspace contains the three required directories at its root:

* src contains Go source files organized into packages (one package per directory),
* pkg contains package objects, and
* bin contains executable commands.

When a build is finished, this workspace is filled with:

* The source code and compiled end result of your project.
* The source code and compiled end result of the dependencies

The `go get` of future builds could be improved if this workspace is shared.

## Storing the workspace in cache

I added a script
[step](http://blog.wercker.com/2013/07/23/Spotlight-on-pipeline-steps.html)
to the end of my
[wercker.yml](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/werckeryml/) that rsync's the Go full workspace, but excludes the source directory.

```yaml
  - script:
          name: Store cache
          code: |-
              rsync -avzv --exclude "$WERCKER_SOURCE_DIR" "$GOPATH/" "$WERCKER_CACHE_DIR/go-pkg-cache/"
```
## Populate cache

I added a script step that first checks if the cache directory is
present, and if this is the case, it rsync's it into the Go workspace at the `$GOPATH`.

```yaml
  - script:
      name: Populate cache
      code: |-
        # WARNING: If you do not use the pjvds/golang box:
        # before you copy and use this step in your own build pipeline
        # make sure you set $WERCKER_SOURCE_DIR to the package directory
        # of your project, like: $GOPATH/github.com/pjvds/httpcallback.io
          if test -d "$WERCKER_CACHE_DIR/go-pkg-cache"; then rsync -avzv --exclude "$WERCKER_SOURCE_DIR" "$WERCKER_CACHE_DIR/go-pkg-cache/" "$GOPATH/" ; fi
```
## The result

The `go get` now has a duration of 0 seconds, the actual time is of
course a handful of milliseconds, but the bottom-line is that we
improved the build time with 55 seconds!

  1. get code (0 sec)
  2. setup environment (14 sec)
  3. environment variables (0 sec)
  4. setup golang (0 sec)
  5. **go get (0 sec)**
  6. go build (0 sec)
  7. go test (1 sec)
  8. saving build output (0 sec)
