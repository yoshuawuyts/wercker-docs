# Getting Started with wercker

This guide will walk you through your first project with wercker and showcase the primary features wercker has to offer.

Before we start with developing our first application, make sure you have registered for a [wercker account](https://app.wercker.com/users/new).

***
##### NOTE: at this moment we are in public beta, you can sign up [here](https://app.wercker.com/users/new). Wercker is still a bit rough around the edges; send us feedback and questions via [email](mailto:pleasemailus@wercker.com).
***

After you've signed up, you are ready to get started with wercker. For your convenience we have created five separate Getting Started repositories in
[Ruby](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-ruby),
[Python](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-python),
[Node.js](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-nodejs),
[Go](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-golang), and
[PHP](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-php).

You can follow along with this section in two ways. First, we have a [guided tour](/articles/gettingstarted/web.html) of the wercker web interface. Second, there is a [specific guide](/articles/gettingstarted/cli.html) that helps you get up to speed with the wercker [command line interface](/articles/cli/).

You can find the [language specific](/articles/languages) sections below:

* [Ruby](/articles/languages/ruby.html)
* [Node.js](/articles/languages/nodejs.html)
* [Python](/articles/languages/python.html)
* [Go](/articles/languages/go.html)
* [PHP](/articles/languages/php.html)
